Task 1: PseudoCode

# Query the user 
What is your name? 
# Query the user's hydration routine (i.e. drinking water habits)
How many cups of water do you drink every day? 
Please type in a numerical number 

#Input Validation
If the number is non-numerical i.e. have words or characters rather than a number in a string
  return an error statement and also return to the first question. This would require
  a while loop. 
else 
  break the loop and continue to the conditional statements 

#Conditional statements
If number of cups is greater than or equal to 8 
  Show them the number of cups they have drank
  Encourage the user to keep on the habit
else if less than 8 cups
  Encourage them to drink more water, as it will decrease the risk of dehydration.
